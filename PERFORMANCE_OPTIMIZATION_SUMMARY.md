  - Modal/overlay animations
  - Slide animations for mobile menus

#### **New Performance Optimization Hook**
- âœ… Created `usePerformanceOptimization.js` hook that provides:
  - Device capability detection (mobile, low-end device, connection speed)
  - Adaptive animation settings based on device performance

  - Performance utilities (debounce, throttle, RAF wrappers)
  - Optimized image loading configurations

### 3. CSS Performance Optimizations

#### **Enhanced performance-optimizations.css**
- âœ… Added mobile-first performance optimizations
- âœ… Implemented touch-optimized interactions
- âœ… Added GPU-accelerated transforms and animations
- âœ… Created performance-optimized card and button interactions
- âœ… Added critical rendering path optimizations
- âœ… Implemented container queries for responsive performance
- âœ… Added `will-change` properties with automatic cleanup
- âœ… Optimized focus states for accessibility and performance

### 4. Mobile-First Performance Focus

#### **Touch Performance**
- âœ… Added `touch-action: manipulation` for better touch responsiveness
- âœ… Implemented `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` to remove tap delays
- âœ… Added `user-select: none` for UI elements to prevent text selection
- âœ… Ensured all touch targets meet 44px minimum accessibility standards

#### **Scrolling Performance**
- âœ… Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for smooth iOS scrolling
- âœ… Implemented `overscroll-behavior: contain` to prevent scroll chaining
- âœ… Added `contain: layout style paint` for better scroll performance

#### **Animation Performance**
- âœ… Reduced animation durations on mobile (0.2s vs 0.3s on desktop)
- âœ… Reduced stagger timing for better mobile performance
- âœ… Conditional animations based on device capabilities
- âœ… Automatic animation disabling for low-end devices

### 5. Performance Monitoring and Testing

#### **Performance Monitor Utility**
- âœ… Created comprehensive `performanceMonitor.js` with:
  - Real-time performance metrics collection
  - Core Web Vitals monitoring (LCP, CLS)
  - Component render time measurement
  - Animation performance tracking
  - Resource loading monitoring
  - Automatic performance reporting in development

#### **Performance Testing Utilities**
- âœ… Component render measurement functions
- âœ… Animation performance measurement
- âœ… Automatic performance logging every 30 seconds in development
- âœ… Performance report generation with actionable insights

### 6. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

#### **Existing Optimizations Maintained**
- âœ… Lazy loading of PaymentForm component in Checkout
- âœ… Vite configuration with manual chunks for better caching
- âœ… Optimized dependencies bundling
- âœ… Image lazy loading with performance-aware quality settings
